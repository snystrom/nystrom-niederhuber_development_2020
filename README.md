This initial release is for generating a DOI of the code base for submission.
Very soon I will push the analysis notebook which reproduces all genomics
figures in the main text with full explanations of how everything works.
Currently I'm making a slimmed down version that includes only published
analysis for clarity. Also currently working on a solution to large file
storage for possible data sharing. If you have any questions feel free to reach
out.

Raw data will be available at [GSE141738](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141738) soon. This repo will also provide further description of the raw & processed data files for increased clarity.
